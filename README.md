# Article recommender
A miniproject for the University of Cambridge Python Bootcamp. \
It uses AI to grade some qualities of articles and lets users grade those themselves too. This data is then used to predict user ratings based on the chatbot ratings for articles that the user has not read. These scores are then shown to the user to help them make a decision if it is worth reading the article. There is no assessment of the relevance of the content etc., only if it aligns with the interests of the user.

## The task
For the weekend, your challenge is: To build an Agentic AI application of your choosing, put in on Github and get your code reviewed in github by at least one other person in your yeargroup. \
You may need to use things that haven't been taught (e.g. building a UI). Use your favourite chatbot to help you find new libraries and do the auxiliary bits!
