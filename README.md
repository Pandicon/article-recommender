A miniproject for the University of Cambridge Python Bootcamp

## The task
For the weekend, your challenge is: To build an Agentic AI application of your choosing, put in on Github and get your code reviewed in github by at least one other person in your yeargroup. \
You may need to use things that haven't been taught (e.g. building a UI). Use your favourite chatbot to help you find new libraries and do the auxiliary bits!
